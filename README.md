Schoolbus Inspection Tracking System
======================

Introduction
----------------

The approximately 3000 school buses in BC are subject to mandatory inspections under the Motor Vehicle Act Regulations. The CVSA eForm is used to record the details of school bus inspection and the data is stored in the RIP (Roadside Inspection Program) database.

The School Bus Program encompasses three major processes:

* Applying for and issuing School Bus permits;
* Scheduling and performing vehicle inspections; and
* Cancelling and/or suspending permits.

The School Bus application tracks that inspections are performed in a timely fashion. For each school bus the application tracks information about the bus (including data from systems of record, e.g. ICBC, NSC), it's past and next inspection dates and results, contacts, and the inspector responsible for next inspecting the bus.

School bus permitting and inspection scheduling was previously tracked in the Automated Vehicle Inspection System on the IMS mainframe.

The application is being developed as an open source solution.

Repository Map
--------------
- **ApiSpec**: The API Specification, in OpenAPI (Swagger) format.  This folder also includes a system to create the OpenAPI files from Excel format input, as well as test data.
- **CCW**: A microservice that provides a SOAP client to ICBC CCW data
- **Client**: The javascript source for the user interface
- **Common**: A library of common methods used by various components
- **FrontEnd**: The Front End server that hosts static content and proxies the API
- **Jenkins**: Jenkins configuration data
- **openshift**: [OpenShift templates](openshift/templates/README.md)
- **PDF**: A microservice for PDF rendering
- **Server**: The API Server 

Installation
------------
This application is meant to be deployed to RedHat OpenShift version 3.  The full application will require 8 Cores of CPU and at least 8 GB of RAM, plus sufficient Persistent Volume storage for the database and configuration secrets.

Two OpenShift templates are provided, one for the build and one for the deploy.  Full details are here: [OpenShift](openshift/templates/README.md)

**CCW Jurisdiction Changes**
In the event that CCW Jurisdiction changes occur, instructions are available at the following location to update the seed data for CCW Jurisdictions.  [CCW Jurisdiction Changes](ApiSpec/CCWJurisdiction/readme.md)

Developer Prerequisites
-----------------------

**Client**
- Node.js
- Text editor such as Sublime Text or VI

**Server**
- .Net Core SDK (.NET Core App 1.1 is used for all components)
- Node.js
- .NET Core IDE such as Visual Studio
- PostgreSQL 9.4 or newer

**DevOps**
- RedHat OpenShift tools
- Docker
- A familiarity with Jenkins

Development
-----------
**Client Code**
The client code is tested using a Node.js application.  Node.js is also used to build the client code into the deployable JavaScript application.

Run npm install from the Client directory to configure the Client build environment

The frameworks used for this application are React/Redux.
 
**API Services**

- Create a local postgres database that you will use for development purposes
- Edit the project launch settings such that the same [environment variables](openshift/templates/README.md) set during deployment are set on your development environment
- Run the code in Development mode, which will allow you to get a Developer Token allowing the application to run outside of a SiteMinder environment.
- A developer token is obtained by going to the following url, where <UserId> is a valid SiteMinder UserId field in the database.
	- `/api/authentication/dev/token?userid=<UserId>`
- The MicroServices "CCW" and "PDF" require an instance of the "Server" component in order to be tested.  However you can run all three applications at once on the same computer, with each running on different TCP ports.  Configure the [Environment Variables] with appropriate settings for each service.

**Code Generation**
A large part of this application was generated through a custom [Swagger Codegen extension] (https://github.com/bcgov/Swagger-Codegen-Extension).  A custom [Swagger Editor](https://github.com/bcgov/Swagger-Editor) was also used to validate the OpenAPI format files that form the API specicification.

Generated sections in the code include:
- Controllers
- Services
- Models
- ViewModels

The generated model was then used to construct the database through the use of [Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/).

**SonarQube**

SonarQube is a code quality service that helps identify problem areas in code through static analysis.

A batch file is provided in the Server code directory that can be used to run SonarQube code analysis on the API Server code.

Before running this batch file, `sonar.bat`, ensure that you have a valid SonarQube account (can be your GitHub account once registered with SonarQube.com) and that your SonarQube token is installed properly on your computer.  You will also need the SonarQube Scanner for C# to be installed on your local computer.

The file sonar.bat will start the SonarQube scanner, execute a build, and stop the scanner.  You may then go to the SonarQube.com website to view the results of the scan.

**Viewing the Database**

This application utilizes the [SchemaSpy](https://github.com/bcgov/SchemaSpy) OpenShift image to provide an easy way for stakeholders to view the database schema.  The SchemaSpy component is a self contained schema viewer application that can be rapidly deployed to analyze the database structure and provide a website to review details of the database.
